        Quick, Baz, get my woven flax jodhpurs! "Now fax quiz Jack! " my brave ghost pled. Five quacking zephyrs jolt my
        wax bed. Flummoxed by job, kvetching W. zaps Iraq. Cozy sphinx waves quart jug of bad milk. A very bad quack
        might jinx zippy fowls.</p>

        exchanged for blue quartz.</p>

        joke won a pager in the cable TV quiz show. Amazingly few discotheques provide jukeboxes. My girl wove six dozen
        plaid jackets before she quit. Six big devils from Japan quickly forgot how to waltz. Big July earthquakes
        confound zany experimental vow.</p>

    <p>Foxy parsons quiz and cajole the lovably dim wiki-girl. Have a pick: twenty six letters - no forcing a jumbled
        quiz! Crazy Fredericka bought many very exquisite opal jewels. Sixty zippers were quickly picked from the woven
        jute bag. A quick movement of the enemy will jeopardize six gunboats. All questions asked by five watch experts
        amazed the judge.</p>
